# Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones

This breakthrough book from James Clear is the most comprehensive guide on how to change your habits and get 1% better every day.


2. Exponentially Improve Your Life
It's normal to not remember every single thing you've done in a day, as a large portion of our daily actions are automatic and done out of habit. Estimates suggest that around 40-45% of our decisions are made through habit. However, this is not a negative thing as habits are an evolutionary skill that our ancestors developed to conserve cognitive processing for more important tasks. Habits are formed through a cue-craving-response-reward system, as demonstrated by the example of smoking where seeing a cigarette or lighter is the cue, the craving to smoke follows, the response is picking up the cigarette, and the reward is the nicotine that the body craved.


Habits are a natural and powerful aspect of our lives, but it's important to recognize that not all habits are beneficial. Many people are unaware that a significant portion of their actions are driven by habit. This is why developing positive habits is so crucial. Habits are so ingrained in our daily routines that we often perform them without conscious thought. Negative habits, however, can have detrimental effects on our lives and future.

Consider the concept of compound interest in mathematics, where small improvements or declines accumulate over time. In the same way, by making small daily improvements of just 1% in our habits, we can see exponential growth in our overall well-being over the course of a year. Conversely, allowing negative habits to worsen by just 1% per day can lead to an exponential decline in our lives.

Developing positive habits is essential to our well-being and success. One of the most important factors in forming habits is the environment in which we live. Our surroundings can either support or hinder our habits. For example, if the television is in your bedroom, it can lead to a habit of watching TV late into the night, or if your phone is charging by your nightstand, it can lead to a habit of checking it first thing in the morning. Understanding the role of our environment in shaping our habits is crucial for making positive changes.

However, with this knowledge, we can use our environment to our advantage by making good habits more obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. This is the secret formula for habit formation. By manipulating our environment in these ways, we can make it easier to follow through with good habits, rather than being influenced by negative ones.

Making good habits can be difficult, but by following these four steps, it can be made much easier. First, make the habits you want to build obvious. This can be done by changing your environment to make the cues for your good habits more obvious. Second, make the habits attractive. You can do this by using temptation bundling and surrounding yourself with people who value the habit you want to build. Third, make the habits easy. Start by setting small, simple goals and using the Two-Minute Rule. Finally, make the habits satisfying. Associate the end of the habit with one of your core values, reward yourself, or track your progress. By following these steps, you can make forming good habits much easier and more successful

Breaking bad habits is a challenging task, but it can be done by changing your lifestyle and environment. The key to breaking bad habits is to invert the process of building good habits by making them invisible, unattractive, difficult and unsatisfying. To make bad habits invisible, remove the cues that trigger them, such as getting rid of cigarettes or taking the TV out of your room. To make them unattractive, reframe your mindset and highlight the benefits of breaking the habit by researching the negative effects and by changing the way you think about the emotions you feel. To make them difficult, use a commitment device such as leaving your wallet at home or setting limitations that restrict you from engaging in the bad habit. To make them unsatisfying, hold yourself accountable by creating a habit contract and punishing yourself immediately after engaging in the bad habit, and having an accountability partner can also help. By following these steps, you can break your bad habits and improve your overall health and productivity
